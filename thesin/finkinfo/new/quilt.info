Description: Tool to work with series of patches
DescDetail: <<
Quilt manages a series of patches by keeping track of the changes
each of them makes. They are logically organized as a stack, and you can
apply, un-apply, refresh them easily by traveling into the stack (push/pop).

Quilt is good for managing additional patches applied to a package received
as a tarball or maintained in another version control system. The stacked
organization is proven to be efficient for the management of very large patch
sets (more than hundred patches). As matter of fact, it was designed by and
for Linux kernel hackers (Andrew Morton, from the -mm  branch, is the
original author), and its main use by the current upstream maintainer is to
manage the (hundreds of) patches against the kernel made for the SUSE
distribution. 

This package provides seamless integration into Debhelper or CDBS,
allowing maintainers to easily add a quilt-based patch management system in
their packages. The package also provides some basic support for those not
using those tools. See README.Debian for more information.
