Package: daemondo
Version: 1.1
Revision: 1
Description: Daemon wrapper program
DescDetail: <<
daemondo is a wrapper program that runs daemons. It starts the specified
daemon on launch, stops it when given SIGTERM, and restarts it on SIGHUP.
It can also watch for transitions in system state, such as a change in
network availability or system power state, and restart the daemon on such
an event.

daemondo works well as an adapter between darwin 8's launchd, and daemons
that are normally started via traditional rc.d style scripts or parameters.

      --pidfile=<pidfile>         A pidfile from which to scavenge the target
                                  pid.

      --restart-wakeup            Restart daemon on wake from sleep.
      --restart-netchange         Restart daemon on a network change.
      --restart-config regex... ; SC patterns on which to restart the daemon.
      --restart-dist-notify names... ;
                                  Distributed Notification Center
                                 notifications on which to restart the daemon.
      --restart-darwin-notify names... ;
                                  Darwin Notification Center notifications
                                  on which to restart the daemon.
      --restart-config regex... ; SC patterns on which to restart the daemon.

daemondo responds to SIGHUP by restarting the daemon, and to SIGTERM by
stopping it. daemondo exits on receipt of SIGTERM, or when it detects
that the daemon process has died.

The arguments start-cmd, stop-cmd, restart-cmd, restart-config,
restart-dist-notify, and restart-darwin-notify, if present,
must each be followed by arguments terminated by a ';'. You may need to
escape or quote the ';' to protect it from special handling by your shell.

daemondo runs in one of two modes: (1) If no stop-cmd is given, daemondo
executes start-cmd asyncronously, and tracks the process id; that process id
is used to signal the daemon for later stop and/or restart. (2) If stop-cmd
is given, then both start-cmd and stop-cmd are issued syncronously, and are
assumed to do all the work of controlling the daemon. In such cases there is
no process id to track. In either mode, restart-cmd, if present, is used to
restart the daemon. If in mode 1, restart-cmd must not disrupt the process id.
If restart-cmd is not provided, the daemon is restarted via a stop/start
sequence.

The argument restart-config specifies a set of regex patterns corresponding
to system configuration keys, on notification of change for which the daemon
will be restarted

The arguments restart-dist-notify and restart-darwin-notify specify a set of
notification names from the distributed and darwin notification centers,
respectively, on receipt of which the daemon will be restarted.

The argument restart-wakeup will cause the daemon to be restarted when the
computer wakes from sleep.

The argument restart-netchange will cause the daemon to be restarted when
the network configuration changes. This is a shortcut for the more
verbose --restart-darwin-notify com.apple.system.config.network_change.

In mode 1 only, daemondo will exit when it detects that the daemon being
monitored has exited.
