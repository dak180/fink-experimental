Description: Semiconductor device development tool
DescDetail: <<
  This project is part of the GNU Project.
  Archimedes is a tool for development of semiconductor
  devices, incorporating some intensive mathematics.

Archimedes is the GNU package for semiconductor device simulations that has 
been released for the first time on 2005 under GPL. 
It has been created by Jean Michel Sellier who is, since then, 
the leader of the project and the main developer. 
It is a Free software and thus it can be copied, modified and 
redistributed under GPL. 
This is the one of the big advantages of using Archimedes.

Archimedes belongs to the well-known family of TCAD software, 
i.e. tools utilized to assist the development of technologically 
relevant products. In particular, this package assists engineers in 
designing and simulating submicron and mesoscopic semiconductor devices. 
In a next-future version Archimedes will also be able to simulate 
nanodevices, using the Wigner formalism. 
Today Archimedes is used in several big companies for simulation 
and production purposes.

Archimedes is also useful for teaching purposes since everybody can access 
the sources, modify and test them. Today, it is used for teaching courses 
in several hundreds universities all around the world. 
Furthermore, a simplified version, developed for students, 
is available on nanoHUB.org.

The Ensemble Monte Carlo method is the method that Archimedes uses to 
simulate and predict the behaviour of a devices. 
Being the Monte Carlo very stable and reliable, Archimedes can be used to 
know the characteritics of a device even before this last is built.

The physics and geometry of a device is described simply by a script, 
which makes, in this sense, Archimedes a powerful tool for the simulation 
of quite general semiconductor devices.

Archimedes is able to simulate a plenty of physics effects and transport 
for electrons and heavy holes in Silicon, Germanium, GaAs, InSb, AlSb, 
AlAs , AlxInxSb, AlxIn(1-x)Sb, AlP, AlSb, GaP, GaSb, InP and their 
compounds (III-V semiconductor materials), along with Silicon Oxide, 
the applied and/or self-consistent electrostatic and magnetic fields by 
means of Poisson and Faraday equation. 
It is, also, able to deal with heterostructures.
