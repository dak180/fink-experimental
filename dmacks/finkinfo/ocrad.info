DescDetail: <<
	GNU Ocrad is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program based on a
	feature extraction method. It reads images in pbm (bitmap), pgm
	(greyscale) or ppm (color) formats and produces text in byte (8-bit) or
	UTF-8 formats. The pbm, pgm and ppm formats are collectively known as
	pnm.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	For better results the characters should be at least 20 pixels high.
	Merged characters are always a problem. Try to avoid them.
	Very bold or very light (broken) characters are also a problem.
	Always see with your own eyes the pnm file before blaming ocrad for the
	results. Remember the saying, "garbage in, garbage out".
	
	Try "ocrad --help" for usage instructions.
