[from http://pingus.seul.org/welcome.html]

Pingus has started at the end of 1998 with the simple goal to create a 
Free (as in freedom, not as in free beer) Lemmings(TM) clone. 
The Free means you get the sources and are allowed and encouraged to change 
and distribute them. You basically get everything that I used to create 
this game. In the years it has grown than quite a bit over the original 
goal and become something more than just a clone, we have original 
artwork, a built-in level editor, new actions, multiplayer and a few 
other features.

If you don't know Lemmings(TM), here comes a short introduction. 
It is a puzzle game developed in 1991 by DMA Design. 
The player takes command in the game of a bunch of small animals and has 
to guide them through levels. Since the animals walk on their own, 
the player can only influence them by giving them commands, 
like build a bridge, dig a hole or redirect all animals in the 
other direction. The goal of each level is to reach the exit, 
for this multiple combination of commands are necessary. 
The game is presented in a 2D site view. For more information you might 
want to visit one of the numerous visit Lemmings(TM) fanpages on the net.

While Pingus is based on the idea of Lemmings(TM), it however doesn't try 
to be an exact clone, it has included a few ideas of its own, 
like the worldmap or secret levels, which might be familiar from games 
the Super Mario World and other Nintendo games. It has also a few new 
actions, like the jumper which weren't presented in the original game. 
To get an impression of the look of the Pingus game you might want to 
have a look at some screenshots.
