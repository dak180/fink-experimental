DescDetail: <<
XML-RPC is a quick-and-easy way to make procedure calls over the Internet.
It converts the procedure call into an XML document, sends it to a remote 
server using HTTP, and gets back the response as XML.
.
This library provides a modular implementation of XML-RPC for C and C++.
.
The library also provides limited facilities for the common variation on 
XML-RPC that uses HTTPS (SSL encryption).
.
The library also provides a variation on XML-RPC that works better in some 
cases (but is not standard): packet stream XML-RPC.
.
XML-RPC For C and C++ is designed for Unix and is most tested on unix. 
As far as we know, it works on any reasonably standard unix.
