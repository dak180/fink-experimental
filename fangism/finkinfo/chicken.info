DescDetail: <<
Chicken is a compiler for the Scheme programming language. Chicken
produces portable, efficient C, supports almost all of the current
Scheme language standard, R5RS and includes many enhancements and
extensions.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Header files have not been put into a separate 'dev' splitoff since
they are needed for the normal operation of the Chicken Scheme
compiler (csc); csc generates intermediate C code that relies on those
headers.
