Description: MiKTeX package manager tools 
DescDetail: << 
  The MiKTeX Tools package does not comprise a TeX system.
  The package should be regarded as an addition to the TeX system
  installed on your system.

  The following utilities are included:
  - initexmf: MiKTeX Configuration Utility
  - mpm: MiKTeX Package Manager
  - mthelp: MiKTeX Help Utility (experimental)

  If you get any errors that say "locale name not valid", set your LANG to 'C'
  like this: $ LANG=C mpm --version
  This will fix the problem.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 By default, mpm installs its packages into %p/share/texmf-local
 or wherever the TeX environment variable $TEXMFLOCAL points to.
 You can determine this directory with the shell command
     kpsewhich --expand-var '$TEXMFLOCAL'
 You can override the default by using the option 
  --install-root with the mpm command.

DescPackaging: <<
	Former maintainer: Sjors Gielen <fink@sjorsgielen.nl>

 BuildDependsOnly: False, because some private headers are included.
 The dylibs are purely local, so no shlibs splitoff is needed.
 ^-- should they be tagged private and the headers scrapped from .deb?

	lynx is required by the cmake file, but we remove it, because
	it doesn't seem to be required here.

	malloc.h inclusions are removed as MacOS doesn't have it
	(malloc is in stdlib.h)

	64-bit function wrappers will simply use the native functions
	in Mac standard C library as they are 64-bit by themselves.

	Fix problems with platforms that don't have unordered_multimap

	Blocker: unimplemented SlowFindFile in unx.cpp. See:
	https://sourceforge.net/p/miktex/bugs/2362/
<<
DescPort: <<
 The LIBCURL_CPPFLAGS configure hack prevents %p/include to appear
 too early on the compiler line.
