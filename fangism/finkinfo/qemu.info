Description: Fast CPU Emulator
DescDetail: <<
QEMU is a FAST! processor emulator using dynamic translation to achieve good
emulation speed.
QEMU has two operating modes:
- Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates
a full system (for example a PC), including a processor and various
peripherials. It can be used to launch different Operating Systems without
rebooting the PC or to debug system code.
- User mode emulation (Linux host only). In this mode, QEMU can launch Linux
processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU. It can be used to launch
the Wine Windows API emulator or to ease cross-compilation and
cross-debugging.
As QEMU requires no host kernel patches to run, it is very safe and easy to
use.
