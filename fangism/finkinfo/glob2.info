Description: Innovative Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game
DescDetail: <<
Globulation 2 brings a new type of gameplay to RTS games. The player chooses
the number of units to assign to various tasks, and the units do their best
to satisfy the requests. This allows players to manage more units and focus on
strategy rather than individual unit's jobs. Globulation 2 also features AI
allowing single-player games or any possible combination of human-computer
teams. Also included is a scripting language for versatile gameplay or
tutorials and an integrated map editor. Globulation2 can be played in single
player mode, through your local network, or over the Internet with
Ysagoon Online Gaming (or YOG for short).
To play, type glob2 in Terminal.app.

DescPort: <<
Scons does not find some files when checking, but compiling is ok, so exit lines are commented.
0.9.4.4 was submitted by fangism.

DescPackaging: <<
